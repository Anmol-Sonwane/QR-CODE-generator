# QR-CODE-generator
node project

--> (We edited the package.json file)
where we added "type": "module"; on the top of "dependencies".

--> Then, we ran the command(npm init -y)(-y is for answering yes to all the basic questions).
--> And before all of the above steps we installed 2 main packages, inquirer & qr-image. Since we're creating a  QR-CODE generator.


For running the code we simply going to add node index.js on the current folder. Then, a prompt is going to popup on screen asking 
URL, and there we only have to add url of any website. And the program is going to create a qr-code image, and text file of the url you entered.
